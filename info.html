        <h2>Safecheck helps you understand what felt wrong.</h2>
        <p>
          If someone said or did something that left you feeling confused, uncomfortable, or unsure — this is a place to figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can take a short quiz about something that happened online or in real life. There are no right or wrong answers, and nobody will see what you choose.

        <p>
          This site doesn’t ask for your name. It doesn’t save your answers. There are no accounts, no logins, and no ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything you do here stays on your device. You can even close it at any time — it’s all up to you.

        <h2>If something felt wrong — let's figure out why.</h2>
        <p>
          Whether something happened in a game, a message, at school, or even at home — Safecheck is here to remind you:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>- You are not the problem.</strong><br />
          <strong>- You are not alone.</strong><br />
          <strong>- You are allowed to ask for help.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You might be here for yourself. Or for a friend. Or a younger sibling. It doesn’t matter — you’re in the right place.

            <h2>You don’t have to take the quiz to get help.</h2>
            <p>
            If you already know something felt wrong — you don’t need to prove it. You can skip the quiz and go directly to someone who’s trained to help.
            </p>
            <p>
            The quiz is here if you want to be more sure, or if you’re still figuring out what to say. It can help you put things into words before talking to someone.
            </p>
            <p>
            You decide what to do next. We’re just here to back you up.
